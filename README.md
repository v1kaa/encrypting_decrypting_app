#### This project is a WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application created for educational purposes as part of my university studies. It provides a user-friendly interface for encrypting and decrypting text using several classic ciphers. This tool is designed to help me understand the workings of different cryptographic techniques. The supported ciphers are Caesar Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, Atbash Cipher, and Rail Fence Cipher.

#### Features
#### Caesar Cipher: A substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
#### Vigenère Cipher: A method of encrypting alphabetic text using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution, employing a keyword to determine the shift for each letter.
#### Atbash Cipher: A substitution cipher where each letter of the alphabet is mapped to its reverse.
#### Rail Fence Cipher: A form of transposition cipher that rearranges the characters of the plaintext into a rail-like pattern.
